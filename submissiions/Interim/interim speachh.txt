Worldwide online shopping has rapidly increased in apparel and clothing items.
problem is that, 
with online shopping , the return rates of these sectors has also highly increased, 
///////////////////
            due to people having different body shapes,
            compare to the user's body measurement, the clothing brand's size chart measuremnts being different. And also the material wise the sizes could be change.
/////////////
for this problrm im developing a system to provide size recommendations.
enter one user specific body measurement (user chest size),
then it would be compared with the specifc clothing brand's size chart measurements and give you a size recommendation. 

(so for that im creating a model, where it would gather, user feedbacks from the past customer purchases from that specfic brand. it will analyze like for specific material , and for this user chest width range, what UK size the customers has bought mostly.)
